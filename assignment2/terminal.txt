    a. Describe how to build and run "Sandbox.java" in terminal.
    First, I need to make sure that I have Java to run and an openjdk 8
    Then I use the command to build a Java file: $javac *.java
    Next I use this command to execute a Java file: $java <MAIN_FILE>
    As long as Sandbox.java exists in the Java pathfile and directory, the program should run
    b. Describe how to do build and run "Sandbox.java" in makefile using "build" and "run" tags.
        - In makefile:
        I use the "command" tag and alternatively "command $(ARG)". Tag1 requires an argument
        - In terminal:
        These commands are use to make tags to help build and run Sandbox.java:
        $ make tag
        $ make tag1 ARG=<VALUE>
        Likewise, tag1 requires an argument to run
